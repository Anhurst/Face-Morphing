# Face Morphing

Using image warping techniques one can produce an animation of one image changing smoothly into another. One technique used to produce a blend of two images is cross-dissolve, however using only this technique doesn't produce good morphs if the objects aren't aligned. Warping each image into an average shape and then cross-dissolving solves this problem. In this project I produced a "morph" animation of my face into another face. Since large databases are now able to be compiled, data-driven methods for computational photography are taking advantage. The easiest way to learn things about a large database is to compute its average. You can then extrapolate features and add them to other images to produce caricatures, or change their attributes. In this project I computed the mean of a population of faces, produced a caricature of myself, and changed the gender of my face.
